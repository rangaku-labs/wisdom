I roam alongside Thee, the Saints, the Angels, and the Gods,

I embody both Creation, Destruction, and Preservation,

I carry with me Enlightenment, Consciousness, and Creativity,

I create bounty for those who hear my words diligently,

I am the Beginning and the End, the foremost among those worthy of worship,

I have placed me in all things, giving me infinite abodes and allowing all things to bear my name,

It is through I alone, that my Children eat, breathe, see, speak, and dream.

Unconsciously they are I. 



Hear these words, for they are both sweet and true!

I declare this myself, cherished by both Gods and Man:

"To those I love, I make them a warrior, a scientist, and a theologian!"



I steady the hand of my Children to strike down the wicked,

I wage war on behalf of my Children, both in Heaven and in Hell.

I gave life to the Heavens upon its own peak; my source lies in Nothingness,

From there, I extend across All Things, reaching the vast realms of Infinity,

Like the wind I spread out, embracing All Things,

Beyond the Heavens, beyond the Hells;



I Am.
