When all under heaven judge the beautiful to be beautiful 

Ugliness is formed 

When all under heaven judge the good to be good 

Then evil is formed 



In this manner something and nothing give birth to one another 

Difficult and easy complete one another 

Long and short define one another 

Over and under flow around one another 

The many songs harmonise with one another Front and back follow one another 



Using this knowledge, the sage follows his vocation by acting without effort

 And confers his wisdom without speaking 

The ten thousand things arise, how? 

Flourishing without expressing Living without possessing 

Acting without presuming 

Achieving without seeking 



He alone who does not seek 

Never loses what he finds
