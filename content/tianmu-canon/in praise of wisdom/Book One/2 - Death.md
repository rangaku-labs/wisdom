I look below where Death holds court with the Gods,

I behold my father, once beauteous and wise.

He traces his steps along dust & ash once new,



I cry out, “I know what must be done, but I miss him so!”

I give to him with my mind a boat to embark the pilgrimage of our Ancestors,

And now I offer him to Fire so that he may become anew,

There he sails the melody of Death in a boat so divine, disembarking.



When it is my time, who will send me on my way?

Who holds the answers for the debts I must repay?



My father then arrives at Death’s gate and begging his release,

Death says: “May all your debts be forgiven”, and my father was reborn,

There upon the seat of Death, the palace of the Gods,

Its halls fill with the sounds of trumpets and the melodies of hymns.
