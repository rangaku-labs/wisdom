The Way of a doctrine is not the true Way 

The Name that can be Named is not the true Name 



Seen Namelessly, it is the origin of Heaven and Earth 

Seen as Named, it is the Mother of all things 



Therefore we must remain without desire 

In order to see its Mystery 



Holding onto desire 

We may only see its manifestation 

These two share the same origin 

But they emerge to receive different names 

Together let's call these the depths 

In the deepest of the depths 

Is the gate to the Mystery in all things
